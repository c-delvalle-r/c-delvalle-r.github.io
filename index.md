Hello! My name is Carlos, I'm a data analyst with over 3 years of experience. I help people make sense of complex data. I am very passionate about involving less technical users in the analysis process to enable them to take informed decisions and, in this way, promote a data-driven culture.

Since I was studying my bachelors in Industrial and Systems Engineering, I have been interested in programming and data analysis. When I tried data analysis for the first time I got captivated by the possibilities that data driven decisions enable in business and operations, and it made me wonder what other areas can benefit from data analysis. Now, as a business analyst with over three years of working experience, I have seen that not only does it have a plethora of application areas, it is also a fundamental skill to drive results through decision making.

I like to continuously learn new things and continue to develop my skills and acquire new ones. As part of that continuous learning, after my bachelors, I studied a diploma in Data Analysis and another in Applied Data Science and AI while also delving into dashboard and data visualizations design best-practices and even a little bit of data engineering.
