Since I was studying my bachelors in Industrial and Systems Engineering, I have been interested in programming and data analysis. When I tried data analysis for the first time I got captivated by the possibilities that data driven decisions enable in business and operations, and it made me wonder what other areas can benefit from data analysis. Now, as a business analyst with over one year of working experience, I have seen that not only does it have a plethora of application areas, it is also a fundamental skill to drive business through decision making.

What I love most about data analysis is that it allows me to empower stakeholders with relevant and timely information to aid in the decision making process. I am passionate about building robust solutions that enhance the flow of information from the data source to the end user and allow them to take informed and prompt action whenever a new business question arises.

I like to continuously learn new things and continue to develop my skills and acquire new ones. My main professional interests are data analysis, data science and project management.
